This data set is provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority via the [NYC Open Data](https://data.ny.gov/) platform. The ridership metrics provided may differ slightly, but are within 1% of ridership figures provided at public MTA board meetings. Data is released weekly. The latest version of the dataset can be found [here](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Hourly-Ridership-Beginning-February-202/wujg-7c2s).

### Potential Goals of Analysis
- What is the best time to schedule maintenance? 
- Which factors are most important to ridership (time of day, day of week, etc.)?
- Which part of the city has the most riders? Which Borough?
- Which station sees the most riders?
- Does Subway usage have seasonal trends? 
- Is there potential to build a model to predict ridership? 

Overall by answering these questions and gaining a further understanding of ridership, it should highlight that the MTA could use data to improve crowd management, service performance and maintenance scheduling.
